       <h2>Most Reliable</h2>
       
<h6>Toyota Yaris</h6>

<p>This workman-like subcompact comes in two- and four-door hatchback versions, with the former being more stylish looking on the outside and the latter offering more in the way of cargo-carrying flexibility. It’s small, slow and simple but has a history of reliability, and fewer gadgets mean less components to break down over time.
<h6>Toyota RAV4</h6>

<p>The compact Toyota RAV4 crossover SUV receives myriad improvements and fresh styling for 2013 that features a conventional lift-up tailgate instead of the side-hinged refrigerator-door style hatch it’s featured since the vehicle’s inception. It remains both durable and family friendly.
<h6>Acura RDX</h6>

<p>Like all the model-year 2013 cars and trucks we’re predicting to last for 250,000 miles with proper care, the RDX gets high marks from J.D. Power and Associates for both initial quality and mechanical reliability over the initial three-year ownership period, received better-than-average ratings for durability from Consumer Reports and is expected to be reasonably inexpensive to maintain and repair, according to data compiled by Intellichoice.com. The agile RDX was upgraded for 2013 with the Honda Accord’s powerful and proven V6 engine and assorted improvements that include a smoother ride and reduced levels of noise, vibration and harshness.

<h2>Going green </h2>

<p>Hybrid and all-electric cars are becoming a mainstream reality. Electric cars have engines that run on electricity and do not require gasoline. Hybrid cars use electricity for short distances and gasoline for long drives and high speeds. These eco-friendly cars come with many advantages to the consumers.
Fuel Costs</p>
<p>The most obvious benefit of owning a hybrid or electric car is the increase in fuel costs. Owning either one will result in fewer trips to the gas pump. These savings really add up over time. A hybrid car will save the driver about 38 percent in fuel in the city and 19 percent on the highway. The only cost in fueling an electric car is the electricity to charge the battery.
Energy Security</p>
<p>Oil is a limited resource, meaning it will eventually run out and become unavailable. An electric car takes this worry away because it does not depend on gasoline at all. A hybrid will use a lot less gas than a traditional engine. An owner of a hybrid can feel confident in knowing they are saving this precious resource.
Tax Benefits</p>
<p>The government offers a tax deduction for buying an eco-friendly car. This is to encourage more people to consider choosing a more environmentally friendly option when buying their next car.
Less Greenhouse Gas Emissions</p>
<p>Carbon and sulfur emissions are greatly reduced in hybrid cars and eliminated altogether in electric cars. Reducing toxic emissions means cleaner air and a healthier environment. By using biodiesel or ethanol in place of gasoline for hybrid cars, drivers can reduce their vehicle’s toxic emissions by as much as 97 percent.
Faster Commuting Times</p>
<p>To increase the incentives for buying an eco-friendly car, major highways are beginning to add lanes that are designated for use only by these cars. As these cars become more popular, it is likely we will see more of these lanes available. Some places are also beginning to designate close, or even free, parking spaces.
Power Efficiency</p>
<p>Materials used in eco-friendly cars weigh less than traditional ones, meaning they maneuver and handle easier. Because they run on electricity, they can operate and function well at any speed. Power is consistent whether driving at high or low speeds. They do not need a transmission to make the engine run at full power, even at lower speeds, like gas-powered engines</p>

<h2>Used Car Buying</h2>

<p>Learn what rights you have when buying a used car. Contact your state or local consumer protection office.</p>
<p>Find out in advance what paperwork you will need to register a vehicle. Contact your state's motor vehicle department.</p>
<p>Check prices of similar models using the NADA Official Used Car Guide published by the National Automobile Dealer Association or the Kelley Blue Book. These guides are usually available at local libraries.</p>
<p>Research the vehicle's history. Ask the seller for details concerning past owners, use, and maintenance. Next, find out whether the car has been damaged in a flood, involved in a crash, been labeled a lemon or had its odometer rolled back. The vehicle identification number (VIN) will help you do this.
Your state motor vehicle department can research the car's title history. Inspect the title for "salvage," "rebuilt", or similar notations.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists VINs of its crash-test vehicles and will let you search an online database of manufacturer service bulletins.</p>
<p>Vehiclehistory.gov and the National Insurance Crime Bureau’s free database are centralized places for consumers to buy information on the history of vehicles gathered from state motor vehicle departments and other sources. These reports are helpful but do not guarantee that a vehicle is accident-free.</p>
<p>The Center for Auto Safety provides information on safety defects, recalls, and lemons, as well as service bulletins.</p>
<p>Make sure any mileage disclosures match the odometer reading on the car.</p>
<p>Check the warranty. If a manufacturer's warranty is still in effect, contact the manufacturer to make sure you can use the coverage.</p>
<p>Ask about the dealer's return policy. Get it in writing and read it carefully.</p>
<p>Have the car inspected by your mechanic. Talk to the seller and agree in advance that you'll pay for the examination if the car passes inspection, but the seller will pay if significant problems are discovered. A qualified mechanic should check the vehicle's frame, tires, air bags and undercarriage, as well as the engine.</p>
<p>Examine dealer documents carefully. Make sure you are buying- not leasing- the vehicle. Leases use terms such as "balloon payment" and "base mileage" disclosures</p>

<h2>Car Maintenance</h2>
<a name="maintenance"></a>


<p>Maintaining your car can help you avoid certain mechanical failures and keep you on the
road longer.</p>

<h6>Engine and tranny</h6>

<p>Preventive maintenance can help keep your engine running longer, especially if it has high millage.
There are a lot of ways to help keep your engine healthy and a few are listed below</p>



<h6>Oil changes</h6> <p>this help keep internal parts of your engine lubricated so that heat and
friction have less an impact on parts of the car. Dirty oil can drive down your mpg and
clog up various parts of the engine leading it to failure. Engine oil should be replaced
every 3000 and 10,000 for synthetic brands</p>
<p>Coolant flushes, this is almost as important as oil changes this helps keeps your engine
from reaching high temperatures that can damage seals that keep fluids in place. As
most liquids coolant losses its ability to draw heat from your engine over time and must
be replace every 4 yrs or 50,000 miles.</p>
<p>Replace air filters every year. This helps keep dirt from entering the engine especially
expensive sensonrs.</p>
<p>The transmission should have its oil level check every time you go in for an oil check.
This help keep the tranny properly lubricated.</p>


<h6>Tires</h6>

<p>Tires is where the car meats the road and is an essential part that needs maintenance. Checking
the tire pressure can help you avoid uneven tire wear and help maintain mpg.</p>

<p>Rotation of tires helps keep them on the road longer. The front wheels of a car wear out faster
than the rear by rotating the tires you prevent over wearing of the front tires which can cause serious
injury.</p>

<h6>Brakes and rotors</h6>

<p>This part of the car helps you stop. Not checking these parts can lead to a disaster. Things to
look out for are</p>



<h6>Brake fluid level</h6><p>top up with dealer specified brand to help avoid unnecessary wear of
internal parts.</p>
<p>Make sure your brake fluid is the right color. If it turns milky it is time for new fluid and
replacement is necessary to avoid damage to critical parts of the breaking system.</p>
<p>Look at your brake pads and rotors to see if they are in good condition.</p>
