<h2>Choosing a Dealer</h2>

              		
              		
<p>In this information age, make your first stops on the keyboard. Sales people actually like customers who've surfed the web for info like dealer cost and vehicle features. It's then just a matter of taking you for a test drive, and making sure the vehicle is a comfortable fit.</p>
<p>Visit the websites of potential dealers to see if they're kept up to date, or is listings linger long after the cars have disappeared from the lot. Check out their Customer Service Index (CSI) that rates buyer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Do some low-tech research too. On-the-street reputation can be just as useful a buying guide as any computer data. Ask relatives or friends if they had a good experience at a particular dealership. If you see the dealer's nameplate on a car in a parking lot, strike up a conversation with the owner, and ask if he or she would buy a car there again.</p>
<p>Expect the salesperson to be up front. A dealer interested in earning your trust will fully disclose everything about the transaction. Be ready to walk out if they won't discuss anything but "What if we could do it for this much a month?"</p>
<p>Take a seat in the waiting room, and just listen to what others are saying. Being a fly on the wall can give you a whole different perspective on the way a place treats its customers, long after the new car smell has faded.</p>
<p>Is this a hands-on dealership with the owner actually on the premises each day, or off golfing at some Florida resort?</p>
<p>Do they provide Parts and Service, or just parts of service? Is the service department open during hours that will suit your schedule, like evenings or Saturdays? Do they offer loaners so you're not stuck while your car's in the shop? Or shuttle service to pick you up at home or at work?</p>
<p>Finally, you expect the dealer to be honest - so be honest with yourself. What's your com- fort level when you enter this showroom? Are you greeted professionally, or are you besieged with high-pressure tactics like "What can I do to put you in this car today?" Do you feel on edge because you're being steered toward a certain vehicle, or does the salesperson genuinely listen to what you have to say, and then make recommendations to let you do the choosing?</p>

<p>A little research and awareness on your part at the outset can smooth out any bumps in your car-buying ride. Successful dealers know that repeat customers and referrals are built on trust, and trust is built by treating you with respect, both in the showroom and far down the road.</p>

<h2>Negotiating</h2>
<p>Dealer invoice. The price the manufacturer charges the dealer for a car. Reed says before negotiations begin, ask the dealer to show you the actual invoice. Through your online research, you should already have a sound idea of what the dealer paid for the vehicle, but the invoice will also tell you how long the vehicle has been on the lot. "If it's been on the lot for a month or more, they will be eager to get rid of it," he says.</p>
<p>Dealer cash incentives. Manufacturers often provide the dealers with temporary cash incentives to sell specific car models. These are dollars the customer never sees and often doesn't know about without digging into the research.</p>
<p>Destination fee. The amount the manufacturer charges the dealer to deliver the vehicle to the dealership. It is itemized on the MSRP.</p>
<p>Regional advertising fees. These are the costs of advertising the car in the dealer's market.</p>
<p>Dealer holdback. This is a percentage of the MSRP that the manufacturer sometimes reimburses to the dealer at some point after the consumer has taken delivery. Something like profit sharing, it is cash the dealer receives over and above profit generated from the transaction price.</p>
<p>Reed recommends that you decide what you want to pay for the car and then begin negotiations at a number below that, moving up from there, "adding $500 or so to make them think they are making progress as you move toward the price you have in mind," he says. </p>
